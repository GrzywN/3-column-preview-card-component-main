## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- SCSS/SASS preprocessor
- BEM methodology
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Custom CSS animations/transitions

### What I learned

That was my first project when I was using a CSS grid for building layout. It was great for that and I learned so much about CSS grid and now I am ready to use it in bigger projects. While styling I used repeat() and minmax() functions, which are great solution for responsiveness problems.

### Useful resources
